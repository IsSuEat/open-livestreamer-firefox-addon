"Open in livestreamer Addon" for Firefox
========================================
! IMPORTANT !

It looks like livestreamer, the application this addon uses, is not being maintained any longer. As a consequence sites might stop working when using livestreamer or this addon. 
A [fork of livestreamer](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink) is in the makings, we might switch to that if it evolves well.

This Addon opens sites like twitch.tv, hitbox.tv, YouTube, etc.. with [Livestreamer](http://livestreamer.io/) stream in your favourite mediaplayer. Browse to a stream on one of the [supported sites](http://livestreamer.io/plugin_matrix.html) an click the "Open with Livestreamer" button. The settings can be edited via the Firefox Addon Manager. Get it directly from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-livestreamer/
